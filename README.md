# Awesome-Multimodal-Learning-on-Graphs

A curated list of papers and resources about multimodal learning on graphs. The models we focus here are mainly large multimodal models and diffusion models.

**An awesome repo on large language models (LLMs) on graphs an be found [here](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Awesome-Language-Model-on-Graphs)**.

**This repo will be continuously updated. Don't forget to star <img src="./fig/star.svg" width="15" height="15" /> it and keep tuned!**

**Please cite the paper in [Citations](#citations) if you find the resource helpful for your research. Thanks!**
